Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.

For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
Output: 1

 

Constraints:

    1 <= strs.length <= 300
    1 <= strs[i].length <= 300
    strs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.
    All words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.


problem states that if x and y are similar if there exactly one swap they are similar
it the both x and y are equal then they are similar
the input is a list of strings and each string is an anagram of every other string in the array. where 
our task is to group the strings together ,where strings in the same group are similar to at least one other string in the group 

we have to return the number of strings of such groups that will be formed

there are three solutions to this question
i mean three approacehes the are 
DFS approach
BFS approach
Union Find Data Structure/Algorithm approach

Approach 1; Depth First Search :

we can see that two words A and B belongs to the same group if they are similar or equal , or it there are some words in the group such as X1 , X2 .... XN , such that A is similart to X1 , X1 is similart to X2, ....XN is similar to B , it means that if we can create a path
